			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<h3 class="textbox-text">When you look at society nowadays, you will see inequality and discrimination in all sorts of places. Whether it be at work, school, or even on social media, you are bound to see conflicts that are driven by differences in race, gender, religion, disability, or even simple opinions. LILC aims to spread awareness and discourage discrimination across the globe. We do this by showing the world videos <span style="color: darkblue;"><b>you</b></span> upload!</h3>
			<div class="cooler-div"></div>
			<h1>Videos</h1>
			<h3 class="textbox-text">The main way LILC spreads awareness about societal inequality is by uploading videos on the internet for people all around the Earth to see. These videos are mainly educational and made by supporters of the movement. People upload videos on our upload page on this website. These videos are then reviewed by the LILC moderators. After approval, videos are uploaded on popular social media platforms with the LILC account. The uploader is of course credited and encouraged to upload the video with their account. <a href="upload.html">Upload a video now!</a></h3>
